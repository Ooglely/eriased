A script to easily archive whole Soundcloud pages.
Currently takes a Soundcloud users following list and downloads all songs from those users, without using the closed Soundcloud API.

To run the script, install the node dependencies, then run run.bat.
First time run will set up a config for later use. If you need to change it for any reason, delete config.json.
